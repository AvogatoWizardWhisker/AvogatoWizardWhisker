## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
<p>Hi, i'm @AvogatoWizardWhisker, a digital marketer enthusiast and computer aficionado, I'm on a quest to conquer the realms of C#, HTML, and CSS. With a moniker that conjures images of a mystical feline wielding a wand in one paw and a ripe avocado in the other, he navigates the digital jungle with the kindergarten level of a coder and the skills of a marketer. As for lions, did you know that a lion's roar can be so thunderous it can be heard up to 8.04672 kilometers away? Imagine if they had social media â€“ their posts would literally go viral with every roar!
